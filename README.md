==============

Abhaya Libre is a text typeface designed for trilingual communications in Sinhala, Tamil and English. Abhaya Libre project aims to produce the most advanced and complete Sinhala font with coverage for complex representations in Sinhala, Pali and Sanskrit texts.  

In the true spirit of Libre Fonts movement Abhaya Libre project brought together existing projects and a group of designers to develop a coherent typeface. The project started off with the aim of liberating (open sourcing)FM Abhaya, the popular Sinhala text legacy (ASCII encoded) font by Pushpanada Ekanayake. Tamil glyph-set is based on typefaces by Modular Infotech. Latin was custom designed to match Sinhala glyph-set by Sol Matas.

‘FM Abhaya’ designed in 1996, is the most widely used Sinhala text typeface.

The name ‘Abhaya’ comes after the King Abhaya (474 BCE to 454 BCE) who reigned Sri Lanka from the ancient kingdom of Upatissa Nuwara. The ‘Abhaya Libre’ is the Unicode compliant, complete libre version of the most popular Sinhala typeface on Earth.

In the Unicode adaptation process, the FM Abhaya font was completely redrawn from the scratch to suit the modern use. Abhaya Libre comes in 5 weights which enables designers to build sophisticated typographic layouts. Lighter weights suites mostly for body text and heavier weights look best in title settings.

Abhaya Libre comes with a Latin glyset designed by Sol Matas to match the aesthetics of Abhaya Libre Sinhala. The Latin set was inspired by the style of the original Sinhala, with the notable inherent contrast in between thick and thin strokes, was modified to tally with the visualization logics of Latin typefaces. The ductus references according to the lines of a Didone typeface add some Sinhala forms to certain terminations.

The project was funded by Google, being led by Mooniak, a collaborative collective of designers based in Colombo Sri Lanka with the cooperation of Mr. Pushpananda Ekanayake, the designer  of the FM Abhaya font and Sol Matas as the Latin designer.
